Write a class that represents a credit card. The class should contain four declarations:
- public CreditCard(double balance)
    - This is the constructor for the CreditCard class. This takes in a number and sets it as the starting balance for the card.
- public double getBalance()
    - Returns the money value on the card.
- public void addMoney(double amount)
    - Adds the given amount of money into the card.
- public void removeMoney(double amount)
    - Removes the given amount of money from the card.




This main method should run without issues using your class:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Creates a new card with 10 dollars to start
    CreditCard card = new CreditCard(10);

    // Prints the starting value of the card
    System.out.println("Money in Card:" + card.getBalance());

    // Removes 5 dollars from the card
    card.removeMoney(5);
    System.out.println("Money in Card after Removal:" + card.getBalance());

    // Adds 20 dollars to the card
    card.addMoney(20);
    System.our.println("Money in Card after Adding:" + card.getBalance());
}
