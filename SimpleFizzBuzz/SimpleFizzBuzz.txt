Write a program that prompts the user for a number between one and one hundred, and prints that number. 
If the number is divisible by three, then print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
If the number is divisible by five, then print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
If the number is divisible by both three and five, then print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
