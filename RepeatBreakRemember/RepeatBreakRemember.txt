Implement this program one piece at a time. This is always strongly recommended when writing software, and this exercise attempts to strengthen that skill.
See how far you can get!

Part 1:
Implement a program that asks the user for numbers until the user inputs the number -1. When the user writes -1, the program writes "Thanks! Bye!" and ends.

Part 2:
Extend the program so that it prints the sum of the numbers (not including the -1 at the end) that the user has inputted.

Part 3:
Extend the program so that it also prints the number of numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.

Part 4:
Extend the program so that it also prints the mean (average) of all of the inputted numbers (not including the -1).

Part 5:
Extend the program so that it prints the number of even and odd numbers (excluding the -1).
