Euan needs a program that will tell him what letter grade he got on a test.
Use the info below to create a program that takes a number grade as input and prints the correct letter grade.

100-90 = A
90-80 = B
80-70 = C
70-60 = D
60-0 = F

If the input is greater than 100 or less than 0, print out the message "Not Possible" or something similar.
